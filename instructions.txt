# SimpCalc Project

Authors: Jade Ramos, Rafael Sese, Gian Valencia

## How to Run

There are two ways to run the project:

### Option 1 – Manual:

1. Make sure all input files are in the same directory. Scanner expects files in the format:
   sample_input*.txt

2. Run the scanner:
   python scanner.py

   This will produce output files in the format:
   sample_output_scan*.txt

3. Run the parser:
   python parser.py

   The parser reads sample_output_scan*.txt and produces files in the format:
   sample_output_parse*.txt

### Option 2 – Using run.py:

1. Make sure all input files are in the same directory. Scanner expects files in the format:
   sample_input*.txt

2. Run the combined script:
   python run.py
   
   This will automatically run the scanner and parser on all relevant files and produce the corresponding outputs.
